# Overview

The Carbon Black Cloud is a cloud-native endpoint protection platform (EPP) that provides what you need to secure your endpoints using a single, lightweight agent and an easy-to-use console.

<a name="deployall">

## Deploy Custom Connector + 3 Playbook templates
This package includes:
* [Logic Apps custom connector for Carbon Black](./CarbonBlackConnector)

  ![custom connector](./CarbonBlackConnector/CarbonBlackListOfActions.png)
* Three playbook templates leverage CarbonBlack custom connector:
  * [Response from Teams](./Playbooks/CarbonBlack-TakeDeviceActionFromTeams) - allow SOC to take action on suspicious devices arrived in incidents (apply a pre-defined policy or quarantine) and change incident configuration directly from Teams channel. Post information about the incident as a comment to the incident.
  * [Quarantine device](./Playbooks/CarbonBlack-QuarantineDevice) - move the device arrived in the incident to quarantine (if not already quarantined). Post information about the incident as a comment to the incident.
  * [Enrichment](./Playbooks/CarbonBlack-DeviceEnrichment) - collect information about the devices and post them as incident comment.

You can choose to deploy the whole package: connector + all three playbook templates, or each one seperately from it's specific folder.

# CarbonBlack connector documentation

<a name="authentication">

## Authentication
This connector supports API Key authentication. When creating the connection for the custom connector, you will be asked to provide the API key which you generated in Carbon Black platform. [API Key authentication](https://developer.carbonblack.com/reference/carbon-black-cloud/authentication/#creating-an-api-key).

<a name="prerequisites">

### Prerequisites in Carbon Black
1. CarbonBlack clound end point should be known. (e.g.  https://{CarbonblackBaseURL})
2. Generate an API key ([learn how](https://developer.carbonblack.com/reference/carbon-black-cloud/authentication/#creating-an-api-key)), and grant it  **/appservices/** Access level.
(For playbooks built from scratch which leverage the process API, /investigate/ Access level is also relevant.)

3. For Response from Teams playbook, a policy needs to be created, so SOC will be able to move a device to it from the Teams adaptive card.

2.	Click edit API connection
3.	Click Authorize
4.	Sign in
5.	Click Save
6.	Repeat steps for other connections such as Teams connection and CarbonBlack connector API  Connection (For authorizing the CarbonBlack connector API connection, API Key needs to be provided. The API Key is the combination of API Key / API Id)
#### b. Configurations in Sentinel
